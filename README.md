Sketches using Parametrics for Open Source 3D Fabrication

For this assignment I was asked to create a drawing in OpenSCAD that used Parametrics. I drew up a simple object and altered the top of it three different ways using the true and false commands. My objects were a popsicle, a big lollipop, and a round lollipop. Once I remembered how to code using for() I blew through it quickly with little stress.
